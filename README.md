# climate-change-and-crop-yield
An Exploratory data analysis on the effect of climate on crop yield in developing countries (GHANA,NIGERIA,KENYA,SOUTHAFRICA)
Global warming has become one of the most environmental issues discussed. This is due to the impacts climate has on crop yields, weather patterns, sea levels, wildfire incidents and ecological systems With the world population excepted to hit a double by 2050, global food production would have to double to meet the need of rising population (4). The threat to food security from climate change is a critical issues for a number of businesses like food and beverages, retails, agriculture, insurance, biofuels, transportation and so on. Developing countries may be more at risk of this food scarcity.

Knowing that developing regions are more vulnerable to the risks that climate change pose, it would be useful to narrow our scope and varities of crop commonly produced in those area.The countries include the four countries represented in the Womentechsters fellowship,which are Ghana,Nigeria,Kenya, and SouthAfrica.

The crops include the following:

1.Rice

2.Maize

3.Cotton

4.Sugarcane

5.Millet

The data was collected and analysed from the year 2010 to 2018

This was a colaborative project
